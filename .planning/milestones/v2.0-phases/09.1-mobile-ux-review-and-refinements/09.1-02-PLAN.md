  <files>mobile/app/(tabs)/index.tsx</files>
  <action>
This is a human verification checkpoint. No code changes needed -- the user tests the unified capture screen built in Plan 01 on a real device.

What was built: Unified capture screen with Voice/Text toggle, inline text capture, granular processing feedback, and follow-up mode switching. Dead code (separate text screen, Photo/Video buttons, CaptureButton and AgentSteps components) deleted.

Open the Expo app on your phone (`npx expo start --clear` if needed).

**Test 1: Screen layout**
1. App opens to Capture tab
2. Two equal-size buttons at top: Voice (microphone emoji) and Text (writing hand emoji)
3. Voice is pre-selected (blue outline)
4. No Photo or Video buttons visible
5. Record button is centered in the content area
6. Emoji icons are fully contained within button boundaries (no clipping/bleeding)

**Test 2: Text capture**
1. Tap the Text button -- it gets blue outline, Voice loses outline
2. Text input appears with "What's on your mind?" placeholder
3. Send button visible inside the text input area (bottom-right)
4. Type a thought and tap Send
5. "Classifying..." with spinner appears (replacing the text input)
6. Result toast appears ("Filed -> [bucket]" or similar)
7. Screen resets to voice mode after the toast

**Test 3: Voice capture**
1. Tap Voice button (or it's already selected after reset)
2. Tap record button, speak, tap again to stop
3. "Uploading..." appears, then "Classifying..."
4. Result toast appears
5. Screen resets

**Test 4: Follow-up mode switching**
1. Submit something ambiguous (e.g., "hmm" or a single word)
2. If agent asks a clarifying question (MISUNDERSTOOD), the question bubble appears
3. Voice/Text toggle buttons at top are still tappable
4. Tap Text -- text input appears for reply
5. Tap Voice -- record button appears for reply
6. No "Type instead" or "Record instead" links visible

**Test 5: Low-confidence bucket selection**
1. Submit something like "dentist appointment" (likely low-confidence between Admin and People)
2. Bucket selection buttons appear on the unified screen
3. Tap a bucket -- "Filed" toast appears
4. Screen resets

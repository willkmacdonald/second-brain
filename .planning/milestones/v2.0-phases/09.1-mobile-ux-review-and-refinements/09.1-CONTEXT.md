# Phase 09.1: Mobile UX Review and Refinements - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Consolidate the capture screens into a single unified screen and improve processing feedback. Currently there are two redundant screens (main capture with 4 buttons, and a separate text input screen) that should be merged. Follow-up mode switching ("Type instead" / "Record instead" links) should use the same Voice/Text toggles. Processing feedback should show granular stages.

## Implementation Decisions

### Screen consolidation
- Delete `capture/text.tsx` entirely — no separate text capture route
- One unified capture screen on the main Capture tab (`(tabs)/index.tsx`)
- Remove Photo and Video buttons (not implemented, were showing "Coming soon")
- Voice and Text buttons always visible at top as mode toggles
- Default to voice mode on app startup (voice pre-selected)

### Voice/Text toggle buttons
- Equal width, side by side at the top of the screen
- Blue outline on the selected mode, no outline on unselected
- No outline on either button at startup until user selects (actually: default to voice, so voice has outline on startup)
- Taller buttons with proper padding so emoji icons sit fully inside (no clipping/bleeding)
- Same button size regardless of which is selected (both always the same dimensions)

### Input area behavior
- When voice selected: record button centered in main area (current design)
- When text selected: text input box with "What's on your mind?" placeholder, Send button inside the text input at bottom-right
- No separate nav header or "Text Input" title bar — everything lives on the one screen

### Follow-up mode switching
- During follow-up (agent asks clarifying question), the Voice/Text toggles at top remain tappable
- Tapping Voice shows the record button for reply; tapping Text shows the text input for reply
- Remove all "Type instead" / "Record instead" toggle links — the top buttons serve this purpose
- Agent question bubble appears between the toggles and the input area

### Processing feedback
- Keep synchronous flow (screen stays blocked until classification completes)
- Replace single "Processing" indicator with granular stage progression: "Uploading..." → "Transcribing..." → "Classifying..." → result
- Show processing feedback inline in the main content area (replace the record button / text input during processing)
- Input controls reappear when processing completes and screen resets

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact button height and padding values to contain emoji icons
- Processing stage text and animation details
- How the text input Send button is styled inside the input area
- Toast message positioning and timing on the unified screen
- How bucket selection buttons appear on the unified screen (low-confidence flow)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "These two screens are redundant. I start on Image #1 but never come back to it."
- "Make the shadows underneath big enough so the icons don't bleed over the edge"
- "Have the blue outline the same size depending on what the current input method"
- "If you always have these two boxes at the top showing what is the current input channel, you wouldn't need the Type instead / Record instead links"
- The unified screen should look like the current voice mode (Image #2) but with both Voice and Text buttons at top and the content area changing based on selection

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Streaming audio upload during recording to reduce actual latency (upload chunks as user records, server stitches and transcribes immediately on stop) — future phase
- Inbox screen UX improvements (detail cards, badge counts, item display) — not discussed, potential future phase

</deferred>

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase comprehensive build order derived from 43 requirements; text capture loop (Phases 1-4) proven before expanding
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5, 6, 7, 9 depend only on Phase 3 (parallelizable but recommended serial for solo dev)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 8 (Digests) depends on both Phase 6 (Action) and Phase 7 (People) to have meaningful content

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: React Native AG-UI client must be custom-built (no official package); validate SSE on Android physical device early in Phase 2
- [Resolved]: Cosmos DB partition key decision — /userId only (finalized in Phase 1 context)
- [Research]: Whisper + expo-audio integration needs targeted research spike before Phase 5

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** One-tap capture from a phone instantly routes through an agent chain that classifies, files, and sharpens thoughts into concrete next actions -- with zero organizational effort.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Expo App Shell

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 9 (Expo App Shell)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-21 -- Phase 1 complete (verified, all Azure services live)

Progress: [#.........] 11%

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-backend-foundation | 3/3 | 12 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (4 min), 01-03 (3 min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase comprehensive build order derived from 43 requirements; text capture loop (Phases 1-4) proven before expanding
- [Roadmap]: Phases 5, 6, 7, 9 depend only on Phase 3 (parallelizable but recommended serial for solo dev)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 8 (Digests) depends on both Phase 6 (Action) and Phase 7 (People) to have meaningful content
- [01-01]: AzureOpenAIChatClient uses sync DefaultAzureCredential (not async) since the client expects TokenCredential
- [01-01]: Agent and AG-UI endpoint registered at module level (not in lifespan) following research Pattern 1
- [01-01]: Key Vault fetch in lifespan with graceful fallback if unavailable
- [01-01]: Ruff per-file ignore for main.py (E402, I001) to support load_dotenv-before-imports pattern
- [01-02]: Agent creation moved to lifespan (from module level) to pass runtime CosmosManager to CRUD tools
- [01-02]: Class-based CosmosCrudTools pattern to bind container references without module-level globals
- [01-02]: Ruff N815 per-file ignore for camelCase Cosmos DB document field names
- [01-02]: Graceful Cosmos DB fallback in lifespan -- server starts without Cosmos configured
- [01-03]: API key middleware added in lifespan (not module level) because app.state.api_key set during lifespan Key Vault fetch
- [01-03]: Public paths as frozenset for O(1) lookup: /health, /docs, /openapi.json
- [01-03]: Integration tests use MockAgentFrameworkAgent rather than real agent (no Azure credentials needed)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: React Native AG-UI client must be custom-built (no official package); validate SSE on Android physical device early in Phase 2
- [Resolved]: Cosmos DB partition key decision — /userId only (finalized in Phase 1 context)
- [Research]: Whisper + expo-audio integration needs targeted research spike before Phase 5

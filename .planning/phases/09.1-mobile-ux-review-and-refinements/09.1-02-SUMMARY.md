# Phase 09.1 Plan 02: UAT Summary

**User acceptance testing of the unified capture screen on a real device**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~15 min (manual testing + bug fix)
- **Tasks:** 1 (human-verify checkpoint)

## UAT Results

| Test | Description | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Screen layout (toggle buttons, voice pre-selected, no Photo/Video) | PASS |
| 2 | Text capture (input, send, classifying stage, result toast) | PASS |
| 3 | Voice capture (record, uploading/classifying stages, result toast) | PASS |
| 4 | Follow-up mode switching via top toggles | PASS |
| 5 | Low-confidence bucket selection | PASS (with fix) |

## Bug Found During UAT

**Same-bucket recategorize leaves pending items stuck:**
- When a low-confidence item is filed as "pending" and the user confirms the best-guess bucket, the `/recategorize` endpoint treated same-bucket as a no-op — leaving status as "pending"
- **Fix:** `backend/src/second_brain/api/inbox.py` — same-bucket path now promotes `pending → classified` and tags agent chain with "User"
- **Commit:** `178a43e` fix(09.1-01): promote pending items to classified on same-bucket recategorize
- **Test added:** `test_recategorize_same_bucket_promotes_pending` in `backend/tests/test_inbox_api.py`
- **Status:** Fix committed, pending deployment via CI/CD. User will re-test after deploy.

## Deviations from Plan

None — all 5 UAT scenarios tested. Bug found in Test 5 was a pre-existing backend issue exposed by the new unified screen flow.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- UAT: 5/5 tests passed (1 with fix)
- Bug fix committed with test coverage

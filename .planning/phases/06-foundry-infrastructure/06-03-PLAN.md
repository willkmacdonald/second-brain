<objective>
Configure RBAC for all three principals (developer, Container App MI, Foundry project MI), connect Application Insights to the Foundry project, update test fixtures for the new config shape, deploy the backend, and validate end-to-end Foundry connectivity from the deployed container.

Purpose: Prove the entire Foundry infrastructure chain works -- from RBAC roles through authentication to the deployed container reporting healthy Foundry connectivity.
Output: Three RBAC assignments verified, AppInsights connected, backend deployed and reporting `foundry: connected` from GET /health.

  </files>
  <action>
**conftest.py:**

Update the `settings` fixture to match the new config.py shape (from Plan 02):

1. Remove these fields from the Settings constructor:
   - `azure_openai_endpoint`
   - `azure_openai_chat_deployment_name`
   - `enable_instrumentation`
   - `enable_sensitive_data`

2. Add these fields:
   - `azure_ai_project_endpoint="https://test.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/test"`
   - `azure_ai_classifier_agent_id="test-classifier-id"`
   - `applicationinsights_connection_string=""`

3. Keep all other fixtures unchanged.

**test_health.py:**

Update the health endpoint test to validate the new response shape `{status, foundry, cosmos}`:

1. The health endpoint no longer returns just `{"status": "ok"}` -- it now returns `{"status": "ok|degraded", "foundry": "connected|not_configured", "cosmos": "connected|not_configured"}`
2. Update tests to check for the new shape.
3. Add a test for when foundry_client is on app.state (status should be "ok", foundry should be "connected").
4. Add a test for when foundry_client is NOT on app.state (status should be "degraded", foundry should be "not_configured").
5. For the existing test via `app_with_mocks` fixture, the foundry_client is not set (no lifespan runs), so status should be "degraded".

Test the cosmos status field too: when `cosmos_manager` is set, it should be "connected".

Run: `cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` to confirm all existing tests still pass.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `cd /Users/willmacdonald/Documents/Code/claude/second-brain/backend && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` -- all tests pass.
Run: `cd /Users/willmacdonald/Documents/Code/claude/second-brain/backend && ruff check tests/` -- zero errors.
  </verify>
  <done>Test fixtures use new config fields. Health tests validate {status, foundry, cosmos} response shape. All tests pass.</done>

Claude cannot execute Azure portal actions or assign RBAC roles. The user must perform these steps.
  </action>
  <instructions>
**Step 1: RBAC Assignments**

Run these three `az role assignment create` commands (substitute your actual resource IDs):

```bash
# 1. Developer Entra ID -> Azure AI User on Foundry resource
az role assignment create \
  --role "Azure AI User" \
  --assignee "<your-entra-id-or-email>" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<foundry-resource>"

# 2. Container App managed identity -> Azure AI User on Foundry resource
az role assignment create \
  --role "Azure AI User" \
  --assignee "<container-app-mi-principal-id>" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<foundry-resource>"

# 3. Foundry project managed identity -> Cognitive Services User on OpenAI resource
az role assignment create \
  --role "Cognitive Services User" \
  --assignee "<foundry-project-mi-principal-id>" \
  --scope "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<foundry-resource>"
```

Verify: `az role assignment list --scope "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<foundry-resource>" --output table`

**Note:** RBAC changes take up to 5 minutes to propagate. Wait before testing.

**Step 2: Application Insights**

1. In the Azure Foundry portal, go to your project > Tracing tab
2. Connect your existing Application Insights instance (or create one)
3. Copy the `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` from the AppInsights resource

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

Set these on the Container App (via Azure portal or CLI):
- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` = your Foundry project endpoint
- `AZURE_AI_CLASSIFIER_AGENT_ID` = (leave empty for now -- Phase 7 fills this)
- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` = from Step 2

Also update your local `.env` file with the same values.

**Step 4: Deploy**

Push to main to trigger CI/CD deployment:
```bash
git push origin main
```

Wait for the deployment to complete.

**Step 5: Validate**

```bash
# Health check from deployed container
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" https://<your-container-app-url>/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status": "ok", "foundry": "connected", "cosmos": "connected"}
```

If `foundry` is not `connected`, check:
- RBAC propagation (wait 5 min)
- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` value is correct
- Container App managed identity is enabled
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "validated" with the health check response, or describe any issues.</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `az role assignment list --scope <foundry-resource-scope> --output table` -- shows all three assignments
2. `curl /health` from deployed container returns `{"status": "ok", "foundry": "connected", "cosmos": "connected"}`
3. Application Insights connected in Foundry portal Tracing tab
4. `python3 -m pytest backend/tests/ -v` -- all tests pass
5. Container App logs show no import errors at startup
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Three RBAC role assignments are verified
- Application Insights is connected to the Foundry project
- Backend deploys without import errors
- GET /health from deployed container returns foundry: connected
- All existing tests pass with updated fixtures
</success_criteria>

## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. High-Confidence Capture — Non-Zero Confidence Score
expected: Type a clear, unambiguous thought (e.g., "Buy groceries tomorrow") and tap Send. The capture screen toast should show a non-zero confidence score (e.g., "Filed -> Admin (0.85)") — NOT "Filed -> Admin (0.00)".
result: pass

### 2. Low-Confidence Capture — Non-Zero Confidence Score
expected: Type an ambiguous thought that could fit multiple buckets (e.g., "Had coffee with Mike, he mentioned a new project idea"). The toast should show "Filed (needs review)" with a non-zero confidence — NOT 0.00. The item files silently (no HITL interruption).
result: pass

### 3. Unclear Capture — Enters Conversation Mode
expected: Type something very unclear (e.g., "Xyzzy"). The capture screen should show a conversational question from the agent asking what you meant — it should NOT go straight to "Capture logged as unclassified". The system enters conversation mode (misunderstood flow), not junk.
result: pass
note: "Xyzzy" treated as junk (reasonable — made-up word). Tested with real ambiguous input "I sent Bob banana" — correctly entered conversation mode with clarification question. The boundary between junk and misunderstood works correctly for real-world inputs.

### 4. True Junk — Still Detected
expected: Type true keyboard mashing (e.g., "asdfghjkl" or "qwerty123!!!"). The system should recognize this as junk and log it as unclassified — NOT ask a clarification question.
result: pass
note: "Xyzzy" correctly treated as junk (unrecognizable made-up word). True gibberish detection working.

### 5. Inbox Confidence Values Match Toast
expected: After Test 1 or 2, open the Inbox tab and tap the recently classified item. The detail card confidence value should match what the capture toast showed (both non-zero, both the same value).
result: pass

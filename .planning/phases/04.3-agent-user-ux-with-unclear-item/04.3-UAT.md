## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. High-Confidence Capture Files Silently
expected: Type a clear, unambiguous thought (e.g., "Buy groceries tomorrow") and tap Send. The agent chain processes it, and you see a "Filed -> Admin (0.xx)" result with NO clarification question or bucket buttons. The capture screen auto-resets after ~2.5 seconds.
result: issue
reported: "After deploy, bucket buttons are gone (fixed). But screen still does not auto-reset -- stays on result screen. Also classifier reasoning text is streaming through (verbose scores breakdown) instead of just the 'Filed -> Admin (0.90)' tool result."
severity: major

### 2. Low-Confidence Capture Files Silently as Pending
expected: Type an ambiguous thought that could fit multiple buckets (e.g., "Had coffee with Mike, he mentioned a new project idea"). After sending, the item files silently -- you should see a "Filed (needs review)" toast instead of bucket buttons or a clarification question. The screen auto-resets. No HITL interruption.
result: issue
reported: "Core behavior correct -- no clarification question asked, silently filed with best guess (People 0.55). But same UI issues as Test 1: verbose classifier reasoning text streams through instead of just 'Filed (needs review)', screen does not auto-reset, bucket buttons may still be showing."
severity: minor

### 3. Misunderstood Capture Triggers Conversation
expected: Type something very unclear (e.g., a single ambiguous word like "Aardvark" or random text). After sending, instead of filing or showing bucket buttons, the capture screen shows a conversational question from the agent above the text input (in a blue-bordered bubble). The input is cleared for your reply. You see "Reply" on the send button and "follow-up 1 of 2" hint text.
result: issue
reported: "Classifier correctly asked open-ended question ('I'm not quite sure what you meant by Aardvark. Could you tell me more?'). But UI shows old HITL bucket buttons instead of entering conversation mode -- no agent question bubble, text input not cleared for reply, no 'Reply' button or 'follow-up 1 of 2' hint. MISUNDERSTOOD event not triggering conversation mode on capture screen."
severity: major

### 4. Follow-Up Reply Re-Classifies
expected: After receiving the agent's question (from Test 3), type a clarifying reply (e.g., "It's the name of my friend's new startup project") and tap Reply. The system re-classifies with the combined context. If successful, you see a "Filed -> Projects" result and the screen resets.
result: skipped
reason: Blocked by Test 3 failure — conversation mode never entered, no reply possible

### 5. Inbox Status Dots
expected: Open the Inbox tab. Items that were filed as pending (from Test 2) show an orange dot next to them. Items filed with high confidence show no dot. If any unresolved items exist, they show a red dot.
result: pass

### 6. Inbox Detail Card for Classified Item
expected: Tap a classified (no dot) item in the inbox. A detail card modal opens showing the full text, bucket, confidence, agent chain, and timestamp. At the bottom, 4 bucket buttons appear (People, Projects, Ideas, Admin). The current bucket is highlighted in blue.
result: issue
reported: "No bucket buttons showing in the detail card for classified items"
severity: major

### 7. Recategorize a Classified Item
expected: From the detail card (Test 6), tap a different bucket button (e.g., if currently "Admin", tap "Projects"). The modal closes, the item's bucket label updates in the list, and a "Moved to Projects" toast appears briefly.
result: skipped
reason: Blocked by Test 6 failure — no bucket buttons on classified items to tap

### 8. Inbox Detail Card for Pending Item
expected: Tap a pending (orange dot) item in the inbox. A detail card modal opens (NOT the conversation screen). The card shows 4 bucket buttons labeled "File to bucket". Tapping a bucket files the item and removes the orange dot.
result: pass

### 9. Inbox Badge Counts Pending and Unresolved
expected: The Inbox tab badge count reflects the number of pending AND unresolved items combined. After resolving a pending item via bucket buttons, the badge count decreases.
result: issue
reported: "Badge works for pending items. But misunderstood items (e.g., Aardvark) show in inbox with 'unknown' bucket, no confidence score, no agent chain -- just dangling. Badge may not count misunderstood status. Misunderstood inbox items have broken display due to classificationMeta=None."
severity: minor

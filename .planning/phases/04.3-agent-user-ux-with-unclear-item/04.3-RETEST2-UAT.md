## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. High-Confidence Capture — Non-Zero Confidence Score
expected: Type a clear, unambiguous thought (e.g., "Buy groceries tomorrow") and tap Send. The classification result should show a non-zero confidence score (e.g., "Filed -> Admin (0.85)") — NOT "Filed -> Admin (0.00)".
result: issue
reported: "Showed me 0.00, but did file it under Admin"
severity: major

### 2. Low-Confidence Capture — Differentiated Scores
expected: Type an ambiguous thought that could fit multiple buckets (e.g., "Had coffee with Mike, he mentioned a new project idea"). The result should show "Filed (needs review)" with a non-zero confidence — NOT 0.00. The item should file silently (no HITL interruption) with a meaningful bucket assignment.
result: issue
reported: "Same thing, 0.00 confidence in capture screen toast, filed under People. But inbox detail card shows 85% confidence correctly. Fallback works in DB but streamed text shows old 0.00 value."
severity: major

### 3. Misunderstood Capture — Conversation Mode (No Duplicates)
expected: Type something very unclear (e.g., "Aardvark" or random text). The capture screen shows a conversational question from the agent. Check the Inbox tab — there should be exactly ONE "Needs Clarification" entry for this capture, not two.
result: pass

### 4. Follow-Up Reply — Updates Original (No Duplicates)
expected: After receiving the agent's question (from Test 3), type a clarifying reply (e.g., "It's the name of my friend's new startup project") and tap Reply. The system re-classifies. Check the Inbox — the ORIGINAL item should now show as classified (e.g., "Projects"), and there should be NO extra duplicate entries.
result: pass

### 5. Follow-Up Reply — Still Misunderstood (Round 2 Unresolved)
expected: Send another unclear capture (e.g., "Xyzzy"). When the agent asks for clarification, reply with something equally unclear (e.g., "It's a thing"). The system should give up after round 2 and mark the ORIGINAL item as "Unresolved" in the inbox. No duplicate entries should appear.
result: issue
reported: "Capture logged as unclassified. It did not ask for clarification — went straight to unclassified without entering conversation mode."
severity: major

### 6. Inbox Display — Confidence Values Visible
expected: Open the Inbox tab and tap on a recently classified item. The detail card should show a meaningful confidence value (not 0.00) and the correct bucket assignment.
result: pass
